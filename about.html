      <h4><b>Hi, my name is Cindy!</b></h4>
      <br>
      <p>I am a dynamic and curious team player with a passion for problem-solving.</p>
      <p>I embrace diversified collaboration and design products that are useful, easy to use, and fun to interact with. My design process is centred around discovery and early validation. I have a special interest  in user research, usability testing, interaction design and programming.</p>
      <p>Throughout my career in the tourism and hospitality business, I have worked in close contact with the consumer, which has developed my user research and customer service skills but also my empathy, which has led me to UX/UI design.</p>
      <br>
      <h4><b>A little more about me?</b></h4>
      <br>
      <p>I traded my very buttery French pastries for a very Melbournian avocado-healthy toastie. Since my sweet childhood, I’ve been tinkering with websites, learning new languages, and immersing myself in the world of design.</p>
      <p>I have had the chance to live and work in many countries including France, Malaysia, The Netherlands and Canada. This helped me to broaden my horizons and get a glimpse of various customer needs and cultures. </p>
      <p>And during my free time, I try (and sometimes fail) to keep my plants alive.</p>
